# About CitadelShock
CitadelShock is a gamemode that was submitted in the 2017 GmodStore gamemode competition.

Inspired by the game Shockwave Battle (Clonk).</br>
</br>
You are competing to win against another team. You must protect your sides generator or you will lose.</br> 
Your generator is very important, as it allows you to buy bombs - it also generates money periodically.</br>
You can protect your generator by building around it; using foundations, walls, beams, stairs, and other structures.</br>
</br>
While maintaining your generator health and destroying the other teams, you'll also have to gather resources for a majority of the game.</br>
Resources are what you build and repair structures and buy bombs with.
</br>
To inflict damage on the enemy teams generator, you <b>must</b> use bombs/projectiles.</br>
The first team to destroy the others generator is the winner, if no generators are destroyed, the team</br>
with the most remaining generator health wins.</br>
</br>
This is a strategic-teamwork game and you must work with your teammates to be successful.
