# About CitadelShock
CitadelShock is a gamemode that was submitted in the 2017 GmodStore gamemode competition.

Inspired by the game Shockwave Battle (Clonk).</br>
You compete against another team, protecting your generator.</br>
Your generator is important, as it allows you to buy bombs and other useful things.
You can protect your generator by building around it; using foundations, walls, beams, stairs, and other structures.
While protecting your own generator, you must destroy the other teams. To inflict damage on the enemy
generator, you <b>must</b> use bombs/projectiles. These are obtainable from the generator.
The first team to destroy the others generator is the winner, if no generators are destroyed, the team
with the most remaining generator health wins.</br>
</br>
This is a strategic-teamwork game and you must work with your teammates to be successful.
